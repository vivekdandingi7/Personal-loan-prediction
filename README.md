hello,
This case is about a bank (H Bank) which has a growing customer base. The majority of these 
customers are customers having deposits (Saving, Current) and Term Deposit (including Fixed 
Deposits and Recurring deposit accounts) in the bank. The number of customers who are also 
borrowers (customers having loan accounts) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding 
this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest 
on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its customers having 
deposits to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).
The bank wants to build a model that will help them identify potential customers who have a 
higher probability of purchasing the loan. For doing that, the first step in this regard is to explore 
the previous data and drill insights.
You have been provided with a dataset of 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic 
information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities 
account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).
You are brought in as a consultant and your job is to explore the data to understand the 
variables and the impact they have had on Personal Loans so that the bank can leverage the 
insights to reach out to the right customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the 
loan.
#############
1. What percentage of the bank’s customers (according to the data) have availed Personal Loans? 
2. Generate a table with min, max, median & average for all numeric variables (age, experience, 
income, family members, CCAvg, Mortgage). What are your observations? 
3. Create a new categorical variable for Experience using 4 categories –
a. 0 to 10 years
b. 11 to 20 years
c. 21 to 30 years and 
d. 30+ years. 
 Plot a bar graph for this new categorical variable 
 [Hint – You may make use of if else/nested if statements to accomplish this tasks. You can 
refer how Income_Category has been created in the dataset] 
4. Create a scatter plot of the Age and the Experience variable. What do you observe? 
5. What are the top 3 areas (ZIP Codes) where the bank’s customers are located?
6. How many customers have a combination of Fixed Deposits and Credit Cards but not 
Personal Loan? 
7. What is the median income of the customers who have availed personal loans and compare 
it with the median income of those customers who have not availed personal loans? What do 
you infer? 
8. Create 4 separate Pivot Tables. Summarise your data by percentages.
 Education vs Personal Loan
 TD Account Vs Personal Loan
 Online vs Personal Loan
 Income_Category vs Personal Loan

[Hint: Please drag Personal Loan to the Columns area while creating the Pivot Table to get the 
required values]
9. Analyse the Pivot tables created in the previous question and state any anomaly that you 
observe. Which categorical variables appear most important for your further study if you 
want to analyse which customers are most likely to take personal loans and why? 
 
10. In the last campaign, bank reached out to 5000 customers out of which 480 customers 
accepted the personal loan offer. The bank incurred a huge cost in running a marketing 
campaign to reach out to so many customers. This is where you as a strategic business 
consultant step in. You are tasked to optimise the cost of this campaign by identifying the 
correct target base (without significant reduction in number of acceptance of offers). The 
bank can then send Personal Loan offers to these target customers who have a higher chance 
of accepting the offer. Based on your analysis, what strategy would you suggest to the 
management of H bank?
